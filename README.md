Weather Analyzer -- Now in Python!

Using webscraped weather data, app tells user what to wear. Makes use a separate scraper file that would be run on a server at certain predetermined intervals, and the main analyzer file checks the timestamp of the scraped data file before deciding to scrape from the Internet again -- conserving API calls.

Goals: use machine learning to adjust to userâ€™s optimal temperature preferences.
