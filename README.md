Weather Analyzer

Using webscraped weather data, app tells user what to wear.  

Goals: use machine learning to adjust to userâ€™s optimal temperature preferences. 

Inspired by idea conceived by Keith Gladstone, Vlad Feinberg, and Carole Touma
at HackPrinceton Fall 2013. The first version was in the form of an iOS app, built
on an Objective-C platform. This version has been resurrected from scratch by Keith
in April 2015, and is destined to become a web application, on a stack that includes
Java and PHP.
